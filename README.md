# Dirt_Game
This repository contains remnants of code from a personal project I spent a good week or so working on this passed Summer. I greatly underestimated my ability and failed to 
achieve my end goal. 'Dirt's Big Journey' was originally a joke between a few friends of mine before I decided I wanted to make something of it. Dirt is the name of the my 
friend's cat and I had set out to create a 2D action roguelike in the same vain as 'The Binding of Isaac' as this style seemed attainable. I worked with one other person
who I had asked to write a story for me, my dream is to be able to adapt other people's stories into seemingly larger-than-life games. None of their writing made it into 
the project as I had not reached a point where I could begin working with it. Of the remaining code, the only part I am really proud of is map.cs, in that file I wrote
my own random generation algorithm for creating a dungeon map. What stumped me at the end of the day was being able to translate that generated map into the game world in
the form of rooms. I had initially intended to use tilemaps to procedurally lay the tiles along coordinates in relation to the randomly generated 2D array but I failed to 
find a functional solution. This problem is what halted the project, with very few resources to reach out to and nobody having an answer that could assist with my issue
I was completely stopped. Some day in the distant future I would like to give it another go, maybe next time it'll be in Unity as opposed to Godot. I'm happy with what I 
learned from this failed project, I managed to teach myself C# and Godot very quickly and got off to a great start to my game dev journey.
